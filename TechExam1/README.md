# TestInput

"input" :"Whispers of the Night In the quiet of the moon's embrace, Where shadows dance and secrets trace, The night unfolds its velvet wings, And stars ignite like ancient things. The breeze, a soft and tender kiss, Caresses leaves in whispered bliss, As crickets hum their lullabies, And dreams take flight in moonlit skies. Beneath the silver canopy, The world slows down, and hearts break free, For darkness holds a mystic spell, Where time stands still, and all is well. So close your eyes, my weary friend, And let the night its solace send, For in these hours, we find our grace,And dance with stars in silent space."
